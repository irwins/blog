      <description>My team recently got an automation request concerning privileged role access review. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been on the consumer side, so getting some PIM hands-on automation sound like fun! This was an interesting challenge on a few levels, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain as we go along&amp;hellip;&#xA;What is PIM? PIM (Priveleged Identity Management) enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization. The part we&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on is EntraId Role management.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of Azure Resource Graph! When I started with arg in the portal I noticed I coud save my query as private or shared. At that time I didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of until I wanted a better way to manage my queries. That was my aha moment &amp;#x1f601;. Shared queries makes for a better management experience of your queries.&#xA;What are Azure Resource Graph shared queries? Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s documentation explains it best:</description>

      <description>OpenAI is the next shiny thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been following OpenAI developement closely ever since its inception. I was a bit hesitant on upgrading, fearing I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use its full potential (Also I&amp;rsquo;m quite frugal&amp;hellip;&amp;#x1f60f;). Fortunately there&amp;rsquo;s also a pay-as-you-go plan for using the API directly. This gives you more control on your credits.&#xA;When Microsoft announced their version, I was excited about it, as I&amp;rsquo;m always in Azure. I also have a monthly credit to spend.</description>

      <description>Azure Resource Graph (ARG) is one of those things I stumbled upon while learning (or attempting) kusto query. At first, it was just curiousity, and then I realized the possibilities it opens up. In hindsight, it has always been there, but to truly appreciate ARG you need that aha moment that you&amp;rsquo;ll only get by trying it out! So let&amp;rsquo;s dive into some things I learned along the way&amp;hellip;&#xA;What is Azure Resource Graph (ARG)?</description>

      <description>Hi, glad you can join me on my digital transformation journey. Iâ€™ve been in IT some 30+ years now, give or take. My specialty (I use that term loosely) is Microsoft infrastructure. In 2016, I saw the writing on wall at the PSConfEu 2016 conference. There Jeffery Snover talked about &amp;ldquo;digital transformation&amp;rdquo;. At that point I was looking to get started with cloud. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a Microsoft afficionado, so Azure had my preference.</description>
