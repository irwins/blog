      <description>OpenAI is the next shiny thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been following OpenAI developement closely ever since its inception. I was a bit hesitant on upgrading, fearing I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use its full potential (Also I&amp;rsquo;m quite frugal&amp;hellip;&amp;#x1f60f;). Fortunately there&amp;rsquo;s also a pay-as-you-go plan for using the API directly. This gives you more control on your credits.&#xA;When Microsoft announced their version, I was excited about it, as I&amp;rsquo;m always in Azure. I also have a monthly credit to spend.</description>

      <description>Azure Resource Graph (ARG) is one of those things I stumbled upon while learning (or attempting) kusto query.

In hindsight, it has always been there, but to truly appreciate ARG you need that aha moment that you&amp;rsquo;ll only get by trying it out! So let&amp;rsquo;s dive into some things I learned along the way&amp;hellip;&#xA;What is Azure Resource Graph (ARG)?</description>

      <description>Hi, glad you can join me on my digital transformation journey. Iâ€™ve been in IT some 30+ years now, give or take. My specialty (I use that term loosely) is Microsoft infrastructure. In 2016, I saw the writing on wall at the PSConfEu 2016 conference. There Jeffery Snover talked about &amp;ldquo;digital transformation&amp;rdquo;. At that point I was looking to get started with cloud. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a Microsoft afficionado, so Azure had my preference.</description>
