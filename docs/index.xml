      <description>Azure Resource Graph is one of those things I stumbled upon while learning (or attempting) kusto query. At first, it was just curiousity, and then I realized the possibilities it opens up. In hindsight, it has always been there, but to truly appreciate ARG you need that aha moment that you&amp;rsquo;ll only get by trying it out! So let&amp;rsquo;s dive into some things I learned along the way&amp;hellip;&#xA;What is Azure Resource Graph?</description>

      <description>Hi, glad you can join me on my digital transformation journey. I’ve been in IT some 30+ years now, give or take. My specialty (I use that term loosely) is Microsoft infrastructure. In 2016, I saw the writing on wall at the PSConfEu 2016 conference. There Jeffery Snover talked about &amp;ldquo;digital transformation&amp;rdquo;. At that point I was looking to get started with cloud. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a Microsoft afficionado, so Azure had my preference.</description>
