      <description>Previously, I had a look at the bicep testing framework. The assertions done are more to validate parameter,variables and resource names. You can&amp;rsquo;t assert resource size, or properties, as they depend on runtime deployment. I think pester will be a great fit for this &amp;#x1f609;&#xA;Pester is the test framework for PowerShell! When I first got introduced to pester it was for unit testing. As someone who identifies with OPS, it didn&amp;rsquo;t resonate with me, until I saw Kevin Marquette use pester to validate outcome of what a script was suppose to do.</description>

      <description>Bicep is my goto IaC tools for deploying Azure Resources! I recently had a discussion with my team about validating deployments. Now validation is something I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with using Pester &amp;#x1f609;. I remembered reading about bicep having an experimental feature for testing. I though I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try.&#xA;Just a quick heads up it still is in preview aka not ready for production &amp;#x1f601;&#xA;Why validate? Some times, you just want to be sure of the current state of a configuration.</description>
