      <description>Been working on Identity Governance, access review, and I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it can get confusing real fast!&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re still using excel spreadsheet to keep track who should have access or be a member of a security group, then access review is worth looking into!&#xA;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a P2 license to play with Identity governance.

      <description>Previously, I had a look at the bicep testing framework. The assertions done are more to validate parameter,variables and resource names. You can&amp;rsquo;t assert resource size, or properties, as they depend on runtime deployment. I think pester will be a great fit for this &amp;#x1f609;&#xA;Pester is the test framework for PowerShell! When I first got introduced to pester it was for unit testing. As someone who identifies with OPS, it didn&amp;rsquo;t resonate with me, until I saw Kevin Marquette use pester to validate outcome of what a script was suppose to do.</description>
