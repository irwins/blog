      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! It&amp;rsquo;s been a minute! Been trying to keep up with the latest trends in AI. Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s almost a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following what the capabilities are for quite some time now. I remember when Prompt engineer was the next thing, then came context engineering. Then we had MCP servers and agents&amp;hellip; whole fleets!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Agents really changed the game! The latest addition is skills. Skills seem very promising&amp;hellip; Here&amp;rsquo;s where my experiment led me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Been working on Identity Governance, access review, and I&amp;rsquo;ll admit it can get confusing real fast!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re still using excel spreadsheet to keep track who should have access or be a member of a security group, then access review is worth looking into!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a P2 license to play with Identity governance. I still have access to my dev tenant, better put it to use as long as I can&amp;hellip; :wink:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, I had a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://irwins.github.io/blog/posts/bicep-testing-framework/&#34;&gt;bicep testing framework&lt;/a&gt;. The assertions done are more to validate parameter,variables and resource names. You can&amp;rsquo;t assert resource size, or properties, as they depend on runtime deployment. I think pester will be a great fit for this :wink:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pester.dev/&#34;&gt;Pester&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; test framework for PowerShell! When I first got introduced to pester it was for unit testing. As someone who identifies with OPS, it didn&amp;rsquo;t resonate with me, until I saw Kevin Marquette use pester to &lt;a href=&#34;https://pshirwin.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/pester-script-to-test-dns-configuration/&#34;&gt;validate&lt;/a&gt; outcome of what a script was suppose to do. That changed my life!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
