      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;openai-is-the-next-shiny-thing&#34;&gt;OpenAI is the next shiny thing&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following OpenAI developement closely ever since its inception. I was a bit hesitant on upgrading, fearing I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use its full potential (Also I&amp;rsquo;m quite frugal&amp;hellip;:smirk:). Fortunately there&amp;rsquo;s also a pay-as-you-go plan for using the API directly. This gives you more control on your credits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft announced their version, I was excited about it, as I&amp;rsquo;m always in Azure. I also have a monthly credit to spend. You do need to &lt;a href=&#34;https://aka.ms/oaiapply&#34;&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt; for it, but that process is quite easy. Once you gain access the fun can begin!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
