      <description>Bicep is my goto IaC tools for deploying Azure Resources! I recently had a discussion with my team about validating deployments. Now validation is something I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with using Pester &amp;#x1f609;. I remembered reading about bicep having an experimental feature for testing. I though I&amp;rsquo;d give it a try.&#xA;Just a quick heads up it still is in preview aka not ready for production &amp;#x1f601;&#xA;Why validate? Some times, you just want to be sure of the current state of a configuration.</description>

      <description>Bicep support for Microsoft Graph was a long anticipated feature! Supporting Microsoft Graph in bicep allows you to define the tenant infrastructure (think EntraId among other things) you want to deploy. Currently a subset is support (As of 24th May 2024).&#xA;For those new to bicep, bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) that uses declarative syntax to deploy resources&#xA;Just a quick heads up it still is in preview aka not ready for production &amp;#x1f601;</description>
