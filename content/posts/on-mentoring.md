 As a senior SRE (title finally caught up with my age :grin:) one of my responsiblities is mentoring. At first I was a bit hesitent, I'm a bit of a loner. Don't get me wrong once I'm comfortable around you'll wish otherwise...

 Over the years I've learned to be more social and work as a team. I've been in IT well over 25+ years. Back then mentoring wasn't really a thing. You either sink or swim. In this day an time, things evolve so rapidly, even I am in desparate need of guidance!

Anyone who knows me, knows I'm passionate about PowerShell! It so happens that is a skillset  taht could use some polishing up!

Here are some points to consider when mentoring

## It's not about how smart you are

The goal is to help your mentee evolve and find his/her own voice. Don't be too overcritical, it helps to remember you too were beginner at some point. That is something that is still a work in progress for me. I'm notorius for refactoring code! I set the bar quite high for myself. In the past I expected that from everyone as well. That is a a sure way of setting yourself up for dissapointment.

I like this definition of mentoring:

>Mentoring involves sharing knowledge, skills, and experiences to assist the mentee in achieving their goals, overcoming challenges, and maximizing their potential. It typically involves regular communication, feedback, and encouragement from the mentor to empower the mentee to develop their strengths, address weaknesses, and navigate their career path more effectively.

## It's a two way street

Mentees also have their role to play. I think these points apply to all who are continously learning. When I started my Cloud journey I was desperate in need of mentoring
