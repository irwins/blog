Hi, glad you can join me on my digital transformation journey. Iâ€™ve been in IT some 30+ years now, give or take. My specialty (I use that term loosely) is Microsoft infrastructure. In 2016, I saw the writing on wall at the PSConfEu 2016 conference. There Jeffery Snover talked about "digital transformation". At that point I was looking to get started with cloud. I've always been a Microsoft afficionado, so Azure had my preference. I was so convinced of this, I left my employer of 23 years to start my journey. Up to this point my [passion](https://pshirwin.wordpress.com/) was and still is PowerShell. Cloud is so much more than just scripting. Thing are evolving at a such a rapid rate, sometimes it's hard to keep up!

I wanted to share my experiences as someone who identifies as an "Ops" guy and how I managed to get started on my journey, with its ups & downs...It'll be a free format where I'd like to address any and everything cloud related in my journey.

My social handles are on the page. Feel free to reach out!

I hope what I share may be of some benifit to you! ðŸ˜ƒ

Irwin
